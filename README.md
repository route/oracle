### Set up OpenVPN server on Ubuntu 20.04 for free for a lifetime in Oracle cloud

Yes you heard it right, for a lifetime! Oracle Cloud has a [tremendous proposal](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/), on
their Free Tier you can use "Always Free" services including [Arm Ampere A1 Compute](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/compute/arm/)
instances. Yea you can create instances with up to 24 Gb of memory and 4 CPU cores. It can be one or a few it's up to
you, but it should be in the specified limits.

We are going to create OpenVPN server using [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and
[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html). Make sure you have them
installed.

At this point you have Oracle account (if not [set it up](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com/?language=en&sourceType=:ow:o:p:feb:0916FreePageBannerButton&intcmp=:ow:o:p:feb:0916FreePageBannerButton)),
and it's time to create API keys. Go to your profile and click "Add API Key". Copy what you are given and download pem key.

Run commands below, and paste values Oracle provided to `terraform.tfvars`. Copy pem key to the `config/ssh` folder, set
`private_key_path` with the name of your pem key. Fill in `instance_ssh_public_key`, it's used to ssh into the server
using you public ssh key. By default, we create 1 Cpu x 1 Gb machine.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:route/oracle.git
cd oracle/instances/vpn/terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars # Edit this file  
terraform init
terraform apply
```

At this point you have a server and IP address in the output, copy it, we'll need it for Ansible. Open `hosts` file and
paste IP address you copied, fill in easy_rsa_* variables with arbitrary data needed for certificates. `*.ovpn` config
files are generated for clients listed in clients variable. Generate as many as you'd like to have people.

```shell
cd ../ansible
cp hosts.example hosts  # Edit this file
./bin/setup
./bin/clients
```

After running these commands you'll have two openvpn config files `linux.ovpn` and `mac.ovpn` downloaded in clients
folder. Now you can use them to browse internet privately. For linux you can set up OpenVPN tunnel in settings, for mac
I prefer [Viscosity](https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/).
